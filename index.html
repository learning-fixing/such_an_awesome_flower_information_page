        <section>
            <h2 class="apple-font">1. The Rose 🌹</h2>
            <ul class="apple-font">
                <li><strong>The **Rose** is a woody perennial shrub often associated with love and romance. Its stems are typically covered in sharp thorns. It comes in a wide spectrum of colors, each with its own meaning.</strong></li>
                <li>They are primarily native to **Asia**, though some species are found in North America and Europe. They've been cultivated for thousands of years in many different parts of the world.</li>
                <li>Roses are widely used in perfumes, foods, and medicines. Rosewater and rosehip seed oil are common products derived from this beautiful and versatile flower.</li>

            <h2 class="apple-font">2. The Sunflower 🌻</h2>
            <ul class="apple-font">
                <li>**Sunflowers** are known for their large flower heads, which track the sun across the sky—a behavior called **heliotropism**. They symbolize adoration, longevity, and happiness.</li>
                <li>They are native to the Americas and were first domesticated in present-day **Mexico** and the Southern United States. They're valuable for both their beauty and their seeds.</li>

            <h2 class="apple-font">3. The Tulip 🌷</h2>

                <li>While often associated with the Netherlands, tulips originated in the **mountains of Central Asia** and were introduced to Europe in the 16th century, leading to "Tulip Mania."</li>
                <li>They are a popular choice for gardens and cut-flower arrangements, with thousands of different cultivars available in virtually every color except pure blue.</li>
